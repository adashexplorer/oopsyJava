# Encapsulation
> Binding the data members & methods into a single unit is called `Encapsulation`.
> It is used to hide the implementation part and show the functionality for better readability and usability.



## Key points -
- The internal data of an object is hidden from the outside world, preventing direct access. `Data Hiding`
- Only validated or safe values can be assigned to an object's attributes using `setter` method. `Data Integrity`
- Encapsulated code is more flexible & reusable for future modifications or requirements. `Reusability`
- Sensitive data is protected as it cannot be accessed directly. `Security`
- Easy to change the data representation & implementation any time without changing other part of code. `Better code management`
- When one pass an object to a method, everything associated data members & methods are passed along. No need to pass individual
  members. `Simple parameter passing`
- Getter is to display the data & setter is to modify or set the data to provide the functionality to outside world but not to expose
  the implementation to outside. `Getter & Setter`
- Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the data members / fields as `private` and writing `public` methods to set & get values of those
  fields.


## Advantages -
- Data Hiding
- Data Integrity
- Code reusability
- Unit testing is very easy for the encapsulated code



## Disadvantages -
- Sometimes, `encapsulation` can make code more complex and hard to understand if it is not used in right way.
